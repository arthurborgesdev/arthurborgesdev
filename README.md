### Hi, I'm Arthur and I love teamwork and technology! ðŸ’ªðŸ¤“

## Current activities 

Right now I'm improving my coding and teamwork abilities as a Tech Lead/Full Stack Software engineer. I'm more proficient with the JavaScript ecosystem, but I'm having a great time with Rails!

## Goals

I'm getting better each day at Ruby/RoR to be able to also work with this stack.

## Misc

I enjoy a lot nerdy stuff. Right now I have this hobby: [Game boy development with ASM!](https://gbdev.io) ðŸ‘¾
