### Hi, I'm Arthur and I love teamwork and technology! ðŸ’ªðŸ¤“

## My inner workings and past experiences

Since I was a child I was always asking questions. It didn't stop so far. The questions related to "Who am I?", "Where I came from?", "How do I exist?", transformed into questions like "What is consciousness?", "How does consciousness emerge?", "What is emergence? Can it be applied to software?", and so on...

That urge to ask questions and solve problems brought me to computers, to programming and to an electrical engineering degree. I worked for a little more than half a decade in that field, and then moved to software development, my childhood passion.

## Current activities 

Right now I'm improving my abilities as a Software Engineer/Prompt Engineer. When I'm not working or studying related technologies I like to spend time with my family and play video games!

## Misc

I love almost all kinds of music. When I had the time, I will for sure spend time learning and mastering the Melodica!

One of my side projects is a small chiptune synthesizer: water-boatman!
