### Hi, I'm Arthur and I love technology! ü§ì

## My inner workings and past experiences

Since I was a child I was always asking questions. It didn't stop so far. The questions related to "Who am I?", "Where I came from?", "How do I exist?", transformed into questions like "What is consciousness?", "How does consciousness emerge?", "What is emergence? Can it be applied to software?", and so on...

That urge to ask questions and solve problems brought me to computers, to programming and to an Electrical Engineering degree. I worked for a little more than half a decade in that field, and then moved to Software Development, my childhood passion.

## Current activities 

Today I'm enrolled in Microverse school for remote software developers and I'm having lots of fun! I'm learning a lot! While I'm not studying at it, I study by myself and work on other projects, related to embedded programming with C/C++ and functional languages like Elixir.

## Misc

I love almost all kinds of music, except "Xit√£ozinho e Xoror√≥". When I had the time, I will for sure spend time learning and mastering the Melodica!

One of my side projects is to build a digital synthesizer using a NES CPU!!
